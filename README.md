##About
jQuery Flip Clock is a retro looking flip clock that works with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
It is using image sprites in order to reduce load time and the request overhead.

##How to use
The demonstration in index.html already shows what is needed for the clock to properly operate. jQuery is loaded from Google APIs. Additionally, the jQuery easing plugin, the clock's JavaScript file, and the clock's cascading stylesheet is needed.

##Demo
A demo of the clock can be seen here:
